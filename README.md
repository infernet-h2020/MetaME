# MetaME: Metabolic Maximum Entropy modeling 
**M**aximum **E**ntropy modeling of **Meta**bolic flux distributions using Expectation Propagation

## Description

MetaME is a MATLAB implementation of the Expectation Propagation approximation of metabolic flux distributions when (partial) experimental evidence is available. 
The method provides the approximate flux marginals and the Lagrange multipliers enforcing the constraints carried by experimental flux measurements.

This package contains the main script and the datasets used in
