# MetaME: Metabolic Maximum Entropy modelling 
**M**aximum **E**ntropy modelling of **Meta**bolic flux distributions using Expectation Propagation

## Description

MetaME is a MATLAB implementation of the Expectation Propagation approximation of metabolic fluxes distributions when partial experimental information is available. 
The method provides both the approximate flux marginals and the Lagrange multipliers associated with the experimental constraints.

This package contains both the script and the data to reproduce the main results presented in
